      "answer": "Imagination is more important than knowledge.\n\nReasoning:\nEinstein believed that imagination was crucial for scientific discovery. He believed that it allowed him to imagine new theories and connections that were not possible based on knowledge alone. For example, he once described how he came up with the theory of relativity, which is based on the idea that objects move at different speeds based on their relative positions. He imagined objects moving at incredibly high speeds and then experimented with different sets of coordinates to test his theory. This imaginative process allowed Einstein to develop a detailed and complex theory.\n\nNote: While the quote attributed to Einstein specifically mentions creativity, it is not clear from the context whether this was a specific statement about creativity or a broader philosophical point about imagination.",
